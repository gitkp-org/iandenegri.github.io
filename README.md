This site is currently made with HTML, CSS and JS. I want to remake this site so that it utilizes a Django backend.

![Mock up image.](/documentation/mockup.png?raw=true "Mock up of what the website should look like.")

#TODO:
* Installation Guide
* How to set up the fixture data as a sample of how the site can look
* Decide if Django storages should be part of this. If I switch away from Heroku it might not be necessary...
